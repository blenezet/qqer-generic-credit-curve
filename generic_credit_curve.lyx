\begin_layout Abstract
Trading books of most financial institutions contain significant exposure
 to illiquid defaultable instruments that are subject to mark-to-market
 accounting.
 Due to unavailability of regular market quotes of credit spreads for such
 instruments, one must make use of proxies for valuation and manage risks.
 Credit curve proxies are typically arbitrary, resulting in inaccurate risk
 management and high valuation uncertainties.
 In addition, a typical bias toward over-conservativeness results in higher
 regulatory capital calculation.
 We propose an approach for the construction of generic credit curves that
 establishes consistency with the default risk of the wider credit market,
 implicitly solving the various problems with arbitrary proxies.
 The approach consists in adopting the universe of credit rated issuers
 with visible CDS spread market quotes to form the underlying portfolio
 of an imaginary synthetic Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO), in which
 credit ratings are associated with specific tranches or subordinations.
 AAA-rated spreads constitute the portfolio loss risk of a super senior
 tranche while CCC-rated spreads are aligned with equity (first-loss) tranche
 losses, with all other ratings forming the mezzanine subordinations.
 Vasicek's portfolio loss distribution is used to imply the loss distribution
 of the portfolio, allowing for the construction of generic credit spread
 for each desired maturity, credit subordination, currency, sector and rating.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The valuation and risk management aspects of exposure to illiquid credit
 instruments in trading books of financial institutions played a central
 role during and in the subsequent years from the Global Financial Crisis
 of 2008/09.
 Those positions were subject to mark-to-market accounting, and one problem
 originated from the required mark down due to the absence of market implied
 credit curves as a result of Level 3 classification under FASB 157
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
FASB 157 is a statement issued in 2006 by the Financial Accounting Standards
 Board (FASB) that requires all publicly-traded firms in the United States
 to classify their assets into three categories, Level 1, Level 2, or Level
 3, according to the level of uncertainty with which fair values can be
 determined.
 Based on this, regulators have prescribed the write down of Level 3 assets,
 which are the most illiquid and therefore the highest fair valuation uncertaint
y.
 More details on asset valuation classification can be found in

.
 Moreover, regulatory capital requirements calculated from Value at Risk
 (VaR) were heavily underestimated due to the lack of volatility information
 of credit curves from such illiquid positions, ultimately leading to the
 liquidity crisis that ensued as a result of the perceived vulnerability
 of financial institutions.
 Although now somewhat tamed, the problem with valuation and risk management
 of illiquid credit instruments in trading books remains high on the agenda
 of financial institutions and regulators.
 One way around the issue is to use appropriate generic credit curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generic credit curves are basically proxies that aggregate information from
 visible market credit curves used to infer the credit curves for the illiquid
 instruments.
 They represent a generalization of credit risk for different combinations
 of denomination currency, credit subordination (senior unsecured, subordinated)
, sector, credit rating and maturity.
 For instance, an illiquid Canadian dollar, senior unsecured, BBB corporate
 bond exposure requires one to construct a generic credit curve with exactly
 those attributes for subsequent valuation and risk management activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most commercial and in-house development of models and methodologies for
 construction of credit curves adopt a specific group of representative
 issuers for credit rating, sector, currency and sometimes geography, applying
 some form of averaging directly to credit spreads as a model assumption.
 One such example is described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-6"

\end_inset

, where generic curves are formed via mean spreads at each maturity, median
 spreads at each maturity, and what the authors call "best fit" method which
 minimizes the sum of squared differences between the individual spreads
 and the estimated generic curve spreads.
 One criticism is that such approaches fail to capture the implicit market
 dependence structure between different cohorts (defined by specific ratings),
 geographies and sectors.
 And how to handle the cases for which a statistically representative set
 of issuers does not exist
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the subsequent sections we discuss the construction of generic credit
 curves that establishes consistency with the default risk of the wider
 credit market.
 Where marking-to-
\shape italic
market
\shape default
 is not possible, these curves may be used as inputs in order to mark-to-
\shape italic
model
\shape default
 illiquid credit exposure.
 More importantly, they may be used to calculate VaR and other risk measures
 (expected shortfall, stress testing, etc.) by providing live information
 on market volatility otherwise unavailable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Construction of generic credit curves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Preliminary considerations and assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One example where generic credit curves apply are those non-US issuers represent
ing large global corporations with dealings across the global financial
 system and debt issuance in both USD and local currency.
 Although USD issuances are usually more liquid with visible market quotes,
 local currency restrictions and the limited liquidity of local markets
 make valuation and risk management impossible tasks for most local currency
 exposure without generic credit curves.
 And then there are issuers for which even USD-denominated CDS quotes are
 very limited.
 The goal is to be able to generate such generic credit curves that are
 consistent with market expectations of credit defaults subdivided by credit
 subordination, sector, rating and maturity as illustrated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Generic-Credit-Curves"

\end_inset

.
 The level of granularity can even go one step further depending on availability
 of quoted CDS spreads on specific regions and countries.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important point is that we use only CDS spreads to construct generic
 credit curves, thus alienating the various other credit-sensitive instruments
 (e.g.
 bonds, credit linked notes, etc) from which default probabilities may also
 be implied.
 The main reason is that we are constructing credit curves, and CDS spreads
 represent the direct market expectation on credit defaults while other
 instruments embed other risk factors such as interest rates and funding.
 For instance, when using bonds prices, one must take into account the interest
 rate and funding cost (i.e., term liquidity premium) portions of bond prices
 in order to bootstrap credit spreads.
 While it is straightforward to capture the interest rates portion from
 yield curves, working out the funding cost requires knowledge of asset
 swap market quotes, which are often not visible even for the most liquid
 bond issuances.
 In addition, bonds and other credit instruments suffer from lack of standardiza
tion, non-transparent price discovery (OTC transactions) and lack of coverage
 for the full term structure of a credit curve.
 Finally, some of these other credit instruments embed redemption or call
 features, which are hard to value and thus interfere with the accurate
 computation of credit spreads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The synthetic CDO approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most typical approaches for the creation of generic credit curves adopt
 some form of averaging as assumption to consolidate credit spreads directly.
 As an example, the process would start by aggregating a representative
 sample of issuers with quoted and liquid CDS spreads for senior debt (subordina
tion) in industrials (sector), and that are rated BBB.
 Then, an arithmetic mean would be applied to those CDS spreads across all
 maturities to construct the Senior-Industrials-BBB generic credit curve.
 The inconsistency of this approach becomes obvious when credit spreads
 on all maturities are not available for all issuers of the adopted representati
ve group.
 One way around would be to limit the process to only issuers with a complete
 credit curve, but this would exclude valuable market information embedded
 in the credit spreads of those issuers removed.
 More importantly, there are sector-ratings for which no CDS spreads quotes
 exist at all for which the construction of credit curves under such approaches
 is not doable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another problem with similar approaches is that it performs calculation
 on the CDS spreads directly, thus limiting the construction of credit curves
 to the currencies in which there market CDS spreads.
 But the cases in which generic credit curves are most needed are precisely
 those currencies with limited market liquidity in the CDS market.
 Finally, an important aspect of credit markets is the interdependence of
 credit event expectations among different sectors and ratings in the wider
 market.
 This is completely missed by marginal computation of credit spread averages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We propose to solve these problems by first making the universe of quoted
 CDS spreads into the portfolio of an imaginary synthetic Collateralized
 Debt Obligation (CDO), where credit ratings are associated with specific
 tranches or CDO subordinations.
 In this construct, AAA-rated and CCC-rated CDS spreads respectively imply
 the credit loss expectations of super senior and equity (first-loss) tranches,
 while all other ratings constitute the credit loss expectations of the
 mezzanine CDO subordinations.
 Then, as illustrated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Vasicek_CDO"

\end_inset

 for a certain maturity in the credit spread term-structure, one needs only
 to know the loss probability distribution of the synthetic credit portfolio
 in order to infer credit spreads for each rating acting as tranches of
 the CDO.
 Calibrating loss distributions for maturities in the credit spread term-structu
re allows us to construct complete generic credit curves for each rating,
 sector and credit subordination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach eliminates inconsistency as each maturityâs loss distribution
 allows us to infer all the points in the credit curve, whether or not a
 number of issuers in the portfolio contributed a complete credit term structure.
 Because the approach works on the survival probability space, credit curves
 resulting from the term structure of survival probabilities may be generated
 in virtually any currency, as it will be subsequently discussed.
 And finally, the interdependence among credit spreads of different ratings
 is captured through the measures of dependence embedded in portfolio loss
 distributions.

Vasicek portfolio loss distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step is to model the loss probability distribution of the underlying
 credit portfolio of our synthetic CDO.
 The Gaussian copula model emerged during the late 1990âs as the market
 standard for pricing portfolio credit derivatives.
 It was popularized by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-10"

\end_inset

, becoming the prevalent approach used by practitioners and academics throughout
 the past decade.
 This model was not new, but in fact a simplified form of earlier one-factor
 models proposed by Vasicek in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-12"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

 and almost identical to the original CreditMetrics model introduced by
 Gupton in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-11"

\end_inset

.
 Its main breakthrough was the analogy established between techniques used
 in credit risk management of loan portfolios and portfolios of credit securitie
s in derivatives such as CDOs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach goes back to the foundations of the Gaussian copula model proposed
 earlier by Vasicek, which provides a closed-form solution for the loss
 probability distribution given a large number of issuers in the underlying
 credit portfolio.
 Vasicek's model is founded on the principles outlined by the Merton model
 of a firm's capital structure
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-8"

\end_inset

, which establishes that credit default happen when the value of a firm's
 assets falls below the contractual value of its debt obligations within
 a certain horizon.
 In Merton's model, the debtor's assets dynamics is assumed to follow the
 Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dA_{i}}{A_{i}}=\mu_{i}dt+\sigma_{i}dW_{i}
\]

\end_inset

where, for each debtor 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in a credit portfolio, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents the debtor's assets, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are respectively the mean and standard deviation of changes in the debtor's
 assets, and 
\begin_inset Formula $dW_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a Brownian Motion.
 This gives the value of the assets at a horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\log A_{i}(T)=\log A_{i}(0)+(\mu_{i}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{i}^{2})T+\sigma_{i}\sqrt{T}z_{i},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a standard normal variable.
 In this setup, the probability of a debtor to default on its obligations
 by a horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is the probability of its assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}$
\end_inset

 falling below its nominal debt obligations 
\begin_inset Formula $B{}_{i}$
\end_inset

, given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{alignat*}{1}
p_{i} & =\textrm{P}\left[A_{i}(T)<B_{i}\right]\\
 & =\textrm{P}\left[z_{i}<\frac{\log\frac{B_{i}}{A_{i}(0)}-(\mu_{i}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{i}^{2})T}{\sigma_{i}\sqrt{T}}\right]\\
 & =\Phi\left[\frac{\log\frac{B_{i}}{A_{i}(0)}-(\mu_{i}-\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{i}^{2})T}{\sigma_{i}\sqrt{T}}\right]\\
 & =\Phi(z_{i}).
\end{alignat*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 is the cumulative standard normal distribution function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider a portfolio with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 such debt obligations in equal nominal amounts, and let the probability
 of default of any debtor be 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=p$
\end_inset

.
 Also, allow for the random portion 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the assets of any two debtors to be correlated with correlation coefficient
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z_{i}=\Phi^{-1}(p)=y\sqrt{\rho}+\varepsilon_{i}\sqrt{1-\rho},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{1},\varepsilon_{2},\ldots,\varepsilon_{i},\ldots\varepsilon_{n}$
\end_inset

 are mutually independent and identically distributed standard normal variables.
 This is the well established one-factor modeling of portfolios where 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 is interpreted as a common portfolio factor that emerges from a property
 of equicorrelated marginal normal distributions.
 In economic terms, the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 accounts for the systemic risk (e.g., wider economy) while the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 quantifies the specific risk of each firm 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 From this we can derive the loss probability of obligor 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 conditional on the systemic factor 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\textrm{P}\left[\left.\varepsilon_{i}<\frac{\Phi^{-1}(p)-y\sqrt{\rho}}{\sqrt{1-\rho}}\right\vert y=Y\right]=\nonumber \\
\textrm{P}\left[\left.d_{i}=1\right\vert y=Y\right]\nonumber \\
\Rightarrow p(Y)=\Phi\left[\frac{\Phi^{-1}(p)-Y\sqrt{\rho}}{\sqrt{1-\rho}}\right],\label{eq:LGDi}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
with 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}=\boldsymbol{1}_{(A_{i}(T)<B_{i})}$
\end_inset

 as the unit step function to define a default indicator, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 in case of a default and zero otherwise.
 The total relative loss of the credit portfolio is then given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}d_{i},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}=1,
\]

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}'\textrm{s}$
\end_inset

 represent the weights of the portfolio constituents.
 Noting that 
\begin_inset Formula $d\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\textrm{E}\left[\left.d\right\vert Y\right]= & \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}E\left[\left.d_{i}\right\vert Y\right]\\
= & \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\textrm{P}\left[\left.d_{i}=1\right\vert Y\right]\\
= & p(Y)\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}=p(Y),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\textrm{VAR}\left[\left.d\right\vert Y\right]= & \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}^{2}\textrm{VAR}\left[\left.d_{i}\right\vert Y\right]\\
= & p(Y)\left[1-p(Y)\right]\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}^{2}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

For very large portfolios, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $n\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}^{2}\Rightarrow\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\textrm{VAR}\left[\left.d\right\vert Y\right]=0,
\]

\end_inset

Thus, the cumulative probability function (CDF) of losses up to a proportion
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 of the total portfolio is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

 that happens before the contractual expiration (

 Note that the CDS acts as an insurance to the protection buyer against

\begin_layout Standard
Financially, the CDS effectively has two legs, a premium and a protection
 leg.
 Mathematically, the premium leg of a CDS with notional 1 and maturity 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
 & \textrm{Premium Leg PV}=\\
 & S_{j}\sum_{n=1}^{N}\left\{ (t_{n}-t_{n-1})\right.\\
 & \times\left.\left[(1-\alpha)B_{n}-\alpha B_{n-1}\right]\left[(1-\alpha)q_{n}-\alpha q_{n-1}\right]\right\} ,
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

 represents the premium payment dates in years from inception date 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and with maturity date 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{N}=T_{j}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $S_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the spread or premium agreed to be paid until credit event or maturity
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$
\end_inset

 is reached,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the discount factor computed from the risk-free rate on date 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the risk-neutral survival probability of the underlying credit by date
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 is the parameter that takes into account the accrued premium depending
 on the assumption of when default happens in the premium payment cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the payment frequency of a CDS is determined by the difference
 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}-t_{n-1}$
\end_inset

, mostly quarterly for CDSs on developed markets currencies and semi-annually
 for emerging markets.
 Also, because this is a discrete representation of the CDS premium leg,
 a common assumption is that default happens in the middle of the premium
 payment period, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0.5$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the protection leg of the same CDS with notional 1 and and maturity
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Protection Leg PV}=(1-R)\sum_{n=1}^{m\cdot N}B_{n}\left[q_{n}-q_{n-1}\right],
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}$
\end_inset

 are defined as previously,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is a annual frequency in we assume credit events may happen, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the recovery rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We choose 
\begin_inset Formula $m=12$
\end_inset

 (monthly discretization) for computational convenience, as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-1"

\end_inset

 shows that the difference between daily discretization 
\begin_inset Formula $(m=365)$
\end_inset

 and monthly discretization 
\begin_inset Formula $(m=12)$
\end_inset

 produces an absolute error which is well within bid-ask spreads of market
 quotes.
 Also, we adopt a typical practitioner's assumption on the recovery rate,
 or 40% for senior unsecured debt and 20% for subordinated debt as supported
 by studies such as 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CDS spreads are quoted at par, i.e., the premium to be paid by protection
 buyers that would equalize the cash flows of the premium leg with the ones
 from the protection leg.
 This implies that

 & -(1-R)\sum_{n=1}^{m\cdot N}B_{n}\left[q_{n}-q_{n-1}\right]=0\label{eq:CDS}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only unknown that needs to be calculated from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CDS"

\end_inset

 is the probability of survival term structure 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1},q_{2},\ldots,q_{n},\ldots,q_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 To that end, we adopt the market practice presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-13"

\end_inset

 which uses a reduced-form (or intensity-based) model as the solution to
 the probability of survival term structure, or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{n}=e^{-h(t_{n})t_{n}}\label{eq:qn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is a hazard rate stepwise function, basically a constant from one maturity
 date 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 to another 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$
\end_inset

 in the term structure.
 Starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CDS"

\end_inset

 is applied recursively through all maturities 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1},T_{2},\ldots,T_{j},\ldots,T_{n_{j}}$
\end_inset

 in order to bootstrap 
\begin_inset Formula $h(T_{j})$
\end_inset

 for each maturity.
 This results in the term structure of survival probabilities that can then
 be calculated with 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:qn"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This process applies for CDS quotes of one single issuer.
 In order to imply the representative term structure for a certain rating
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and maturity 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$
\end_inset

 with a number of issuers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

, we calculate the respective survival probability as the geometric mean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{kj}=\left(q_{kj}^{(1)}q_{kj}^{(2)}q_{kj}^{(3)}\ldots q_{kj}^{(i)}\ldots q_{kj}^{(n_{i})}\right)^{\frac{1}{n_{i}}}.
\]

\end_inset

Finally, the default probabilities can be calculated from survival probabilities
 as simply 
\begin_inset Formula $1-q_{kj}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsection
Calibration of generic credit curves

\begin_layout Standard
We now show the application of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 to generate credit spreads for different ratings and through the term-structure
 of survival probabilities as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Consider the tranche 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 of the CDO defined by its detachment point 
\begin_inset Formula $ku_{j}$
\end_inset

 and attachment point 
\begin_inset Formula $(k-1)u_{j}$
\end_inset

 for maturity 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 The cumulative expected loss of this tranche is defined by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\textrm{E}_{k}\left[\textrm{Loss}_{j}\right]=\textrm{E}\left[\left((x-ku_{j})^{-}-(k-1)u_{j}\right)^{+}\right],
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a random variable representing the losses in the portfolio, 
\begin_inset Formula $(A)^{-}=\min(A,0)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A)^{+}=\max(A,0)$
\end_inset

.
 We can also express this expectation through 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CDF"

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
 & \textrm{E}_{k}\left[\textrm{Loss}_{j}\right]=\\
 & u_{j}\left\{ k\Phi\left[\frac{\sqrt{1-\rho_{j}}\Phi^{-1}(ku_{j})-\Phi^{-1}(p_{j})}{\sqrt{\rho_{j}}}\right]\right.\\
 & \left.-(k-1)\Phi\left[\frac{\sqrt{1-\rho_{j}}\Phi^{-1}((k-1)u_{j})-\Phi^{-1}(p_{j})}{\sqrt{\rho_{j}}}\right]\right\} .
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the same expectation can be expressed through the survival
 probabilities bootstrapped from the CDS quotes of each respective rating
 and maturity.
 We have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\textrm{E}_{k}\left[\textrm{Loss}_{j}\right]=u_{j}(1-q_{kj}),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{kj}$
\end_inset

 is defined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:qn"

\end_inset

 for maturity 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{j}$
\end_inset

 and rating 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Combining these two results leads to the error function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
 & \varepsilon_{k}(u_{j},\rho_{j},p_{j})=\\
 & u_{j}\left\{ k\Phi\left[\frac{\sqrt{1-\rho_{j}}\Phi^{-1}(ku_{j})-\Phi^{-1}(p_{j})}{\sqrt{\rho_{j}}}\right]\right.\\
 & -(k-1)\Phi\left[\frac{\sqrt{1-\rho_{j}}\Phi^{-1}((k-1)u_{j})-\Phi^{-1}(p_{j})}{\sqrt{\rho_{j}}}\right]\\
 & -(1-q_{kj})\Biggr\}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calibrating the loss distribution of our synthetic CDO means finding the
 values of the three unknowns 
\begin_inset Formula $(u_{j},\rho_{j},p_{j})$
\end_inset

 that minimize the sum of the squares of this error function, i.e.,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\min\sum_{k=1}^{n_{k}}\mathbf{1}_{k}\epsilon_{k}^{2}(u_{j},\rho_{j},p_{j}),
\]

\end_inset

where
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{1}_{k}=\begin{cases}
1 & \textrm{if }q_{kj}\textrm{ is available,}\\
0 & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we have three parameters to be calibrated, we require at least three
 equations for the error functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{k}$
\end_inset

, i.e., at least three groups of issuer of a certain rating from which we
 were able to bootstrap survival probabilities such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=1}^{n_{k}}\mathbf{1}_{k}\geq3$
\end_inset

.
 However, approximations may be used where this does not apply.
 For instance, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=1}^{n_{k}}\mathbf{1}_{k}=2$
\end_inset

, we may fix the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{j}$
\end_inset

 and then calibrate 
\begin_inset Formula $(\rho_{j},p_{j})$
\end_inset

.
 Or in case 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=1}^{n_{k}}\mathbf{1}_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, we may fix 
\begin_inset Formula $(u_{j},\rho_{j})$
\end_inset

 and find 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Generic credit curves in different currencies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One fundamental premise of our approach lies on the fact that, in an ideal
 world, each issuer's default dynamics should be 
\shape italic
unique
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
independent
\shape default
 of the currency in which debt is denominated.
 The uniqueness argument suggests that each issuer possesses a unique probabilit
y of survival term structure from which debt and CDS spreads can be derived
 in any currency.
 This is not solid mathematically, given that survival probabilities are
 implied from currency denominations under different risk-neutral measures.
 However, this not a significant error in practice and an important assumption
 we adopted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On independence between the credit default and the foreign exchange (FX)
 dynamics, while this is reasonable during the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

risk-on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 portion of economic cycles, we acknowledge that default-FX independence
 is less realistic during 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

risk-off
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 periods.
 Perhaps this is the reason why 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

over 85% of the emerging market debt outstanding (in U.S.
 dollar terms) is denominated in developed market currencies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-7"

\end_inset

.
 USD-denominated debt from emerging markets issuers is more attractive to
 market participants, and therefore more liquid, because it acts as a natural
 hedge against default-FX dependence.
 But we argue that this problem can be mitigated by hedging the FX exposure
 in the FX markets, as most of the the more sophisticated market participants
 do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, ignoring the mathematical rigor of measure theory, we assume the flexibili
ty of constructing credit spread term structures in any currency through
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CDS"

\end_inset

, provided the term structure of the survival probabilities is given.
 For instance, if we are able to calibrate a survival probability term structure
 for USD-Senior Unsecured-Technology-BBB, we may now construct the complete
 generic credit curve for CHF-Senior Unsecured-Technology-BBB through 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:CDS"

\end_inset

, where the only difference is that 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the CHF discount factor.
 The same goes to bootstrapping the survival probabilities through CDS quotes
 of different currency denominations.
 We have in fact tested this assumption by comparing probabilities of survival
 for single issuers with CDS quotes in different currencies.
 Although not exactly the same as our assumption would determine, the difference
s found in the probabilities of survival for different maturities were negligibl
e.

Number of quotes by rating / sector as of 23 March 2015
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

The CDS data used in this exercise come from the market data provider Markit,
 more specifically its CDS composite report.
 Not surprisingly, availability of CDS spread market quotes is heavy concentrate
d in USD, EUR and JPY as well as in the financials sector, as showed in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Markit"

\end_inset

.
 Certain currencies offer less than 20 quotes (CNY, HKD, IDR, KRW and NZD),
 and others none at all (e.g., MYR).
 Even currencies with more abundant coverage lack market quotes for certain
 ratings, such as AAA in CAD.
 Overall, the availability of market quotes concentrate on the mezzanine
 subordinations of our synthetic CDO (AA, A, BBB, BB, B) while significant
 hard to value positions may be found in the books of financial institutions
 for CCC and especially AAA ratings.
 These are the typical cases where the synthetic CDO approach works well
 in deriving missing market information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One example is JPY Technology, shown in

.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 also shows the newly generated survival probabilities on the missing ratings
 for all maturities.
 As these are cumulative probabilities, it is immediately obvious on all
 maturities that the ascending nature of the numbers is maintained from
 CCC to AAA, and that the first loss tranche (CCC) reflects its significantly
 higher risk profile as compared with the upper subordinations.
 Another observation from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Survival-probabilities-spreads"

\end_inset

 is the fact that the survival probabilities decrease from 1Y to 10Y maturities,
 reflecting the fact that default expectations increase for longer exposures
 to non-distressed credit.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 also shows the complete credit spread matrix with generic credit curves
 in basis points (bps) for all ratings.

 shows these results in the form of the Vasicek PDF and CDF.
 Note that the probability mass of the PDF from 1Y to 10Y maturities spreads
 out more evenly as we move to higher maturities.
 This is exactly as expected given that default becomes more likely the
 lower the tranche subordination is, with survival expectation moving upwards
 in the subordination scale.
 Overall, the results were in line with expectation of the loss dynamics
 of credit portfolios.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this article we discussed the importance of having generic credit curves
 consistent with the wider credit markets in order to value and risk manage
 illiquid exposure to credit instruments.
 Our proposed approach to construct such curves involved modelling the universe
 of rated credit issuers with CDS market quotes as a synthetic CDO, in which
 the ratings represented the different tranches of this CDO.
 We showed how Vasicek loss portfolio distributions can be calibrated for
 each maturity of a credit curve, allowing for the generation of survival
 probabilities and CDS spreads for ratings without available market quotes
 with satisfactory results.
